Instructions from Kevin to use MySQL:

Install the MySQL module for Node.js:
	- open up the terminal and cd to your project folder
	-  type the following line in terminal / command line
	- "npm install mysql@2.0.0-alpha7"
	- This will install a package folder inside your project folder

	- Note: i wasnt sure if i should upload this folder to the github repo
	- the MySQL module is from: https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql

Installing a local MySQL server on your home computer:
	- a bit more complicated, i will write detailed instructions later
